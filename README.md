Mary, are you there?

What to do:

2. use this: git remote add [your name here] [insert your repo's https address]. Hit enter

3. then add/change a file/do something. Then type git add *

4. Then type git commit -m "whatever you want here"

5. Then type git push -u [whatever name you used in step 2] master

6. You will be prompted to enter in your github username and password

7. If successful, check your repo to verify everything was pushed correctly.
